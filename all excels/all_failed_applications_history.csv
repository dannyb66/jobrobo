About the job
Who We Are
The Friend Club (TFC) is revolutionizing the way engaged couples connect & discover top wedding vendors and inspiration. The wedding industry is over $200bn globally and incumbents are mass market players with no relevance to today's consumer. TFC has built a global, vetted network of top wedding vendors & brands to deliver a seamless, curated solution for couples - ultimately, streamlining the planning process. Thousands of couples are using our platform and we know we are barely scratching the surface of our potential! TFC is available to anyone through our webapp online - www.thefriendclub.com

What We're Looking For
TFC is seeking a highly skilled and motivated engineer with full stack development experience to join our team. You will be a lead / founding member of our engineering team working side by side with our founders, helping us further scale our team. Your primary responsibility will be to help build and scale our iOS app and Node.js backend from the ground up, contributing to all aspects of the development process from user research, marketing, data, design, and product to build the highest-priority features. You’ll conceptualize, design, build, and maintain complex services/platforms/features and develop ownership over our product + infrastructure. You’ll play a critical role in shaping our engineering and broader company culture to help make TFC a happy and fun place to work. You'll build core product features and infrastructure, shipping code daily and iteratively as a trail-blazer, always building for the newest technologies. This is a unique opportunity to shape the future of a product that will be a first mover in the wedding industry.

What You Bring
Startup mentality — You LOVE to work and are highly passionate (even slightly neurotic) about it. You believe in rapid iteration, failing and continuously learning from our users to improve. You understand the tradeoffs of limited startup resources and time to market. You love what you're working on, and are deeply ingrained in solving the problem. A track record of building and scaling mobile applications in a fast-paced environment is needed for this role.

Ownership of the end-to-end experience — You will define the product roadmap and architecture alongside our founders. You will be empowered to take ownership and make instant impact to the product. You will bring learnings and ideas to every discussion, and always represent the voice of our users. You fix problems when you see them, even if it's not your task, constantly contributing to make every user experience feel beautiful and improving the ecosystem for the next engineer that views the code.

Engineer — You’ll be responsible for all aspects of engineering, from implementing beautiful UI/UX, designing data models, analytics and tracking, running db migrations, improving code quality and CI/CD. You'll be responsible for helping to improve the architecture and to continue modernizing the stack, as well as enforcing best practices and a high quality of output.

Impact-driven product thinker — You will be involved in every aspect of the product development process, from prioritization & scoping to implementation. You will constantly need to weigh the need to invest in long-term improvements against the urgency of getting features out the door. We’ll rely on your judgement and leadership.
TFC is a startup. This role is truly a grind/hustle role where you will need to roll up your sleeves and be excited to build and ship products in a timely manner. We are a lean team where you will need to be scrappy with limited resources.

Qualifications
7+ years professional engineering experience (2+ years at a startup is highly desirable or launched ambitious projects of your own!)
Proven experience as an iOS engineer with expertise in Swift, UIKit, and SwiftUI
Built and shipped consumer-facing apps—ideally in social/dating.
Experience with distributed, multi-tiered web systems, and relational databases
Proficiency in at least one modern programming language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, etc.), preferably JavaScript/TypeScript (the more the better)
Experience with cloud services, ideally AWS and infrastructure setup, or alternatively one of the other major providers (Azure, Cloudflare)
Strong backend knowledge with experience in Node.js/TypeScript or Rust with a strong understanding of database connectivity
Knowledge in machine learning, including search, ranking, classification, natural language processing, and image recognition -Knowledge of source control like Github and data analytics tools such as Metabase, Amplitude, GA4, and Looker
Ability to thrive in a fast-paced and ever-changing startup environment
Exceptional collaboration skills, as you will be working with every team member very closely
Willingness to work outside of traditional hours in order to see sprints to fruition (including weekends)

Why Join Us!
Competitive salary ($120,000-$180,000)
Company equity (1-3%)
3 weeks PTO + health days
US remote - Los Angeles preferred

If you’re an experienced engineer with a passion for building meaningful products and a desire to make a difference, we’d love to hear from you.

We'd Love To See
The most impressive thing you’ve built.
Links to repos, projects, or anything that shows your skills

This is more than just a job; it’s a chance to be part of something truly special from the ground up.

About the job
Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer
Aevum is an American technology company that designs, develops, and provides autonomous air, space, and package transportation technologies. The company focuses on autonomous technologies, rapid logistics, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence.
 We are an early-stage aerospace logistics company looking for a bright and motivated Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer to join our team. You will work closely with our Chief Software Architect (12+ years of Silicon Valley experience) to design and build the core frameworks and architecture that power our operations. This role is for someone with around 4-7 years of experience, though we value the quality of experience over the number of years. 

What You’ll Do
Work closely with the Chief Software Architect to build the core frameworks and architecture that will power the company's operations, with a particular focus on the prototyping and proof-of-concept phase of development 
Develop and maintain web applications, internal tools, and backend systems that are scalable, maintainable, and future-proof 
Contribute to defining and evolving our software architecture, with an emphasis on flexibility and long-term sustainability while meeting immediate needs 
Collaborate on setting best practices for code quality, testing, and deployment, ensuring we build on a strong foundation as we scale 
Tackle a wide range of core company problems, gaining a close-up view of key challenges and helping to shape the direction of the company's technical solutions through clean, efficient, and reliable code 
Work across the full stack, iterating quickly to turn early-stage concepts into functional, production-ready solutions 

What We’re Looking For
Strong generalist software engineering skills, with a solid understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles 
Ability to work across the stack (front-end, back-end, with at least some experience with infrastructure and security)
A preference for libraries and frameworks with powerful primitives over ""magical"" solutions (e.g., SolidStart or Remix over Next.js, FastAPI or Flask over Django or Rails) 
Ability to write code quickly and efficiently—whether through proficiency with AI coding assistants or sufficient manual speed—since we have many projects in the prototyping and proof-of-concept stage
Willingness to learn and adapt to new technologies as needed 
Ability to take ownership of projects and work independently while collaborating closely with the team 
Experience with Python and JavaScript
This role will involve little to no low-level or embedded programming, though some experience there could be useful for integrations 

Preferred
Experience with SolidJS (preferred) or other modern frontend frameworks 
Familiarity with cloud infrastructure, databases, or DevOps practices 
Interest in aerospace, logistics, or operations research 
Basic product and design sensibilities, with an ability to think about user experience and intuitive workflows

About the job
About Grace
At Grace, we’re on a mission to improve cost accuracy for the construction industry. To achieve this, we’re reimagining what the pricing experience should look like for construction and infrastructure delivery. We’re a team that takes on hard, messy problems with fresh perspectives. We prioritize building strong foundations over quick hacks, and we don’t shy away from challenges. Since our launch in November 2024, users have completed over 3,600 estimations totaling $247M in value using Grace. We've also been featured by BuiltWorlds, one of the leading voices in construction technology.


About the role
We’re hiring a Founding Engineer – Frontend Focus to join us on this journey. This is a foundational role that will shape not just the product, but the engineering culture and processes as we grow. You’ll help define our technical direction, influence architectural decisions, and help establish the bar for execution speed and code quality.
This role is ideal for someone who thrives in early-stage environments and wants to build core systems from the ground up—while contributing to team growth, values, and product direction.


What we are looking for 
You are a full stack engineer with a deep strength in frontend development. You're passionate about building intuitive, fast, user-friendly web apps. You enjoy solving complex problems and turning abstract ideas into elegant software. If you’ve worked on 0-to-1 product development, that’s a huge plus.


Technical skills:
Strong expertise in React and TypeScript
Solid understanding of data structures, relationships, and modeling
Comfortable contributing to both frontend and backend decisions (e.g. API design, data contracts)
Familiarity with Ruby on Rails is a plus


You might be a good fit if you:
Think like a builder—you love to code, ship, learn, and iterate quickly
Have strong system design skills and can break down complex specs into scalable architecture
Communicate clearly, collaborate well, and bring others into your thinking
Good instincts for when to prioritize speed versus long-term robustness


What we value
We care just as much about how we work as what we build. We're looking for someone who:
Is humble, kind, and collaborative—a true thought partner without ego
Cares about the whole team’s success, not just their own lane
Is hungry and resilient—ready to roll up their sleeves in a fast-paced, dynamic environment
Believes in seeking the truth, not being “right”
Finds meaning in creating tangible value for real users, not just chasing shiny headlines


Logistics
Full-time, contract basis first
Remote-friendly
Being located in the Bay Area is a strong plus


Our philosophy
We’ve seen firsthand how “growth at all costs” can derail a company. We’re building differently—focusing on long-term sustainability and customer value. Our goal is to create a profitable business where great people love the work they do, and where we retain control over how our product and company evolve.

If you're looking for a mission-driven environment where you can shape both the product and the culture—and if you’re motivated by solving real problems for real users—we’d love to meet you.

About the job
About Grace
At Grace, we’re on a mission to improve cost accuracy for the construction industry. To achieve this, we’re reimagining what the pricing experience should look like for construction and infrastructure delivery. We’re a team that takes on hard, messy problems with fresh perspectives. We prioritize building strong foundations over quick hacks, and we don’t shy away from challenges. Since our launch in November 2024, users have completed over 3,600 estimations totaling $247M in value using Grace. We've also been featured by BuiltWorlds, one of the leading voices in construction technology.


About the role
We’re hiring a Founding Engineer – Frontend Focus to join us on this journey. This is a foundational role that will shape not just the product, but the engineering culture and processes as we grow. You’ll help define our technical direction, influence architectural decisions, and help establish the bar for execution speed and code quality.
This role is ideal for someone who thrives in early-stage environments and wants to build core systems from the ground up—while contributing to team growth, values, and product direction.


What we are looking for 
You are a full stack engineer with a deep strength in frontend development. You're passionate about building intuitive, fast, user-friendly web apps. You enjoy solving complex problems and turning abstract ideas into elegant software. If you’ve worked on 0-to-1 product development, that’s a huge plus.


Technical skills:
Strong expertise in React and TypeScript
Solid understanding of data structures, relationships, and modeling
Comfortable contributing to both frontend and backend decisions (e.g. API design, data contracts)
Familiarity with Ruby on Rails is a plus


You might be a good fit if you:
Think like a builder—you love to code, ship, learn, and iterate quickly
Have strong system design skills and can break down complex specs into scalable architecture
Communicate clearly, collaborate well, and bring others into your thinking
Good instincts for when to prioritize speed versus long-term robustness


What we value
We care just as much about how we work as what we build. We're looking for someone who:
Is humble, kind, and collaborative—a true thought partner without ego
Cares about the whole team’s success, not just their own lane
Is hungry and resilient—ready to roll up their sleeves in a fast-paced, dynamic environment
Believes in seeking the truth, not being “right”
Finds meaning in creating tangible value for real users, not just chasing shiny headlines


Logistics
Full-time, contract basis first
Remote-friendly
Being located in the Bay Area is a strong plus


Our philosophy
We’ve seen firsthand how “growth at all costs” can derail a company. We’re building differently—focusing on long-term sustainability and customer value. Our goal is to create a profitable business where great people love the work they do, and where we retain control over how our product and company evolve.

If you're looking for a mission-driven environment where you can shape both the product and the culture—and if you’re motivated by solving real problems for real users—we’d love to meet you.

About the job
About Grace
At Grace, we’re on a mission to improve cost accuracy for the construction industry. To achieve this, we’re reimagining what the pricing experience should look like for construction and infrastructure delivery. We’re a team that takes on hard, messy problems with fresh perspectives. We prioritize building strong foundations over quick hacks, and we don’t shy away from challenges. Since our launch in November 2024, users have completed over 3,600 estimations totaling $247M in value using Grace. We've also been featured by BuiltWorlds, one of the leading voices in construction technology.


About the role
We’re hiring a Founding Engineer – Frontend Focus to join us on this journey. This is a foundational role that will shape not just the product, but the engineering culture and processes as we grow. You’ll help define our technical direction, influence architectural decisions, and help establish the bar for execution speed and code quality.
This role is ideal for someone who thrives in early-stage environments and wants to build core systems from the ground up—while contributing to team growth, values, and product direction.


What we are looking for 
You are a full stack engineer with a deep strength in frontend development. You're passionate about building intuitive, fast, user-friendly web apps. You enjoy solving complex problems and turning abstract ideas into elegant software. If you’ve worked on 0-to-1 product development, that’s a huge plus.


Technical skills:
Strong expertise in React and TypeScript
Solid understanding of data structures, relationships, and modeling
Comfortable contributing to both frontend and backend decisions (e.g. API design, data contracts)
Familiarity with Ruby on Rails is a plus


You might be a good fit if you:
Think like a builder—you love to code, ship, learn, and iterate quickly
Have strong system design skills and can break down complex specs into scalable architecture
Communicate clearly, collaborate well, and bring others into your thinking
Good instincts for when to prioritize speed versus long-term robustness


What we value
We care just as much about how we work as what we build. We're looking for someone who:
Is humble, kind, and collaborative—a true thought partner without ego
Cares about the whole team’s success, not just their own lane
Is hungry and resilient—ready to roll up their sleeves in a fast-paced, dynamic environment
Believes in seeking the truth, not being “right”
Finds meaning in creating tangible value for real users, not just chasing shiny headlines


Logistics
Full-time, contract basis first
Remote-friendly
Being located in the Bay Area is a strong plus


Our philosophy
We’ve seen firsthand how “growth at all costs” can derail a company. We’re building differently—focusing on long-term sustainability and customer value. Our goal is to create a profitable business where great people love the work they do, and where we retain control over how our product and company evolve.

If you're looking for a mission-driven environment where you can shape both the product and the culture—and if you’re motivated by solving real problems for real users—we’d love to meet you.

About the job
ABOUT US

Started by Stanford/MIT serial entrepreneurs, Ruby Robotics is maximizing patient outcomes with tissue insights at the point of care. Using custom-built hardware and AI, our platform optimizes biopsy and surgical procedure workflow while delivering disease analytics early in the patient’s journey. This facilitates faster, more informed treatment decisions for patients as well as improved staffing and operational workflow for hospitals. Funded by healthcare and deep tech VCs, our team is lean, fast, and works intensely towards the goal of improving cancer patient care. 


ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY

We are looking for an experienced and motivated Senior Full Stack Developer who will develop and maintain the frontend and backend software systems for our novel medical instruments. 

 Successful candidates will demonstrate the ability to see a project through product development, commercialization, and post commercialization improvements requiring excellent technical and organizational skills, ability to react to frequent physician feedback, and strong attention to detail. They will have a proven track record of developing, scaling, and maintaining robust frontend and backend systems, ensuring scalability, security, and low-latency data transmission in the regulated medical field. Knowledge in working with sensitive patient information requiring expertise in security engineering, strong encryption, including intrusion detection and monitoring in cloud database solutions is a plus. For qualified candidates, there will be opportunities to expand leadership responsibility across Ruby’s software team. Although we are open to a hybrid role, preference will be given for candidates who are open to working daily on-site with our engineers in San Carlos CA.

 Windows.NET) 
Frontend Development
 Develop desktop applications for Windows and macOS using Dart under the Flutter 
 framework
 Work closely with physicians to iterate on frontend user interfaces
 Ensure secure handling of Protected Health Information (PHI) by implementing robust 
 security and compliance strategies
Collaborate with a cross functional team of product managers, AI scientists, hardware engineers, and other stakeholders to deliver seamless applications
