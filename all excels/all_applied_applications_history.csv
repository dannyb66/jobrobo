Fully remote, with the exception of occasional meetings in San Francisco to collaborate.

Bay Area residency required.

We believe that everyone deserves their own personal army of AI helpers with deep access to company data to automate any task. Datagrid ingests business data continuously from 100+ sources, makes it all available to AI, and eliminates grunt-work such as categorizing 10k support tickets in minutes.

We are a Series-A startup headquartered in San Francisco, but operate as a distributed company. We offer competitive salaries and health benefits, along with equity and respect for work/life balance.

Join our tight-knit team that ships fast and pushes the boundaries of AI! In the last few months, our agents learned to use Microsoft Teams, write SQL queries, and automate tasks on complex schedules like “MWF at half past 9”. Our Agents live where people work (Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.) and automatically take useful actions like producing safety reports from worksite photos.

Responsibilities 

Datagrid Agents operate where our customers work- across Teams, Slack, and even SMS. Agents make multistep plans, leverage vectorized data from 100+ sources, use tools like Docusign, and manipulate the Datagrid app. We cannot possibly test this all manually.

Your job will be to:
Work closely with an ex-Googler who built Gemini evals to create a harness for evaluating Agent performance, make that harness available both for local development and in CI/CD pipelines, and set up alerting for when Agents misbehave.
Influence and contribute to the extension of Datagrid’s Agentic capabilities.
Choose the best open/closed source components to build out the testing infra.
Integrate publicly available benchmarks such as RAGBench into the testing system.
Grant subject matter experts the ability to add to the test library using customer queries, manually authored cases, and synthetically generated questions.
Expose evaluation performance so the company can track improvement over time.

Desired Experience
Proven track record of building test harnesses for Chat Agents from 0 ⇒ 1.
10+ years of B2B software engineering experience.
Ability to write effective LLM prompts without assistance.
Proficiency with nodejs and server side frameworks such as NestJS or NextJS.
Familiarity with JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular JS.

By reducing friction to trade, we aim to unlock this potential, enabling people to thrive and economies to flourish.

With over a decade of combined experience in supply chain technology, we’ve come to understand the obstacles businesses face in moving goods across borders. Our journey begins with duty drawback—a little-known tax recovery process that puts cash back into companies’ hands. It’s an overlooked opportunity: 70% ($7B) of potential refunds go unclaimed annually, largely ignored by current providers.

This is our starting point. We’re well-capitalized and diving into an immense, complex world with a vision to make trade seamless, open, and efficient for companies everywhere. If the adventure of pioneering global trade excites you, you’ll find yourself right at home with Caspian.

You’ll have a front-row seat to shape our tech stack, to experiment, and to set the technical foundation for a company that’s tackling a multi-billion-dollar problem.

What you'll do
Build: Develop and implement tools that redefine industry standards.
Collaborate: Partner with every function to shape our technology and strategy.
Learn + Adapt: Engage with customers, gather insights, and rapidly integrate feedback into our product.
Modernize Legacy Systems: Apply cutting-edge technology to overhaul traditional industry practices.
This role is a singular chance to make a significant impact in a space that matters to the people of this planet, all while working alongside a passionate team committed to driving change.

Who you are
Curious to Explore: You’re driven to apply both new and established technologies, blending legacy systems with cutting-edge tools to tackle big challenges in global trade.
Startup-Minded: You thrive in a fast-paced environment, ready to make a tangible impact with founders who bring expertise and a fresh perspective to a mature industry.
Product Shaper: You’re not just here to code—you’re here to shape Caspian’s product, technical roadmap, and culture, making your voice heard on strategic decisions.
Hands-On with AI: You’re enthusiastic about AI, with experience or interest in leveraging OCR, ML, and LLMs to execute work.
Adventurous Optimist: You bring high energy, a growth mindset, and are eager to collaborate with passionate teammates.
Bay Area-Based: Located in or near San Francisco, you’re ready to work in-person 3+ days a week with the team.

4196042920,Senior Full Stack Engineer,Poppy A,ppy A,ppy A,"About the job
10 months ago, my co-founder and I were broke AF 😂

We were literally days away from moving back to our parents' basements because our AI tool was making a whopping $500/month. Nobody believed in it except us.

Fast forward to today: we just hit $350,000/month, we're on track for $4M+ this year, and next year we'll blow past $10M. Now we're building toward a $1B valuation, and this is where YOU come in.

Hi, I'm Naz, co-founder of Poppy AI.

We built an AI tool that saves creators hundreds of hours. Now we need someone who can help us build new features and scale Poppy AI to handle thousands more users. Is that you?

At Poppy, we've created the first and ONLY multiplayer AI in the world where you can drag & drop YouTube videos, PDFs, voice notes, and images all in one place and collaborate with your team Figma-style! We're helping content creators, founders, and marketers make VIRAL content & ads while saving 100's of hours per month! 🚀

We're incredibly grateful to have over 3,200 amazing customers with just a 3% refund rate, and about 35% of our sales come from word-of-mouth referrals.

The product resonates with people, but we need someone who can help us build new features and scale Poppy AI to the next level!

Your goal will be to help us get to $1 million/month in the next six months.

The Role: The ""Get Shit Done"" Attitude

Imagine this scenario: You're looking at our codebase and you see a feature that could be 10x better with some tweaks. Or you have an idea for something completely new that our users would love.

What do you do next?

If you wait for someone to tell you exactly what to build, this job isn't for you.

If you immediately start sketching out the solution, figuring out how to implement it efficiently, and can't wait to ship it to our users – we want to talk to you.

❌ Who This Is NOT For:
You're looking for ""work-life balance"" and want to clock out at 5pm
You need a stable paycheck and aren't motivated by building something huge
You get annoyed when you receive text messages at 2am
You have a huge ego and think you know everything already
You don't like learning new technology or trying new approaches
You don't listen to feedback from team members
You need constant direction and can't figure things out on your own
You're looking for a chill environment where you can coast
You complain when things get hard or plans change quickly
You're not willing to put in the work now for massive rewards later

✅ Who This IS For:
Working 12+ hours feels natural to you because you're obsessed with building great products
Working 6-7 days a week is your normal mode when building something big
You're constantly learning and adapting your approach
You listen to the team but aren't afraid to push back with data
You figure shit out without needing your hand held
You thrive in high-pressure, fast-moving environments
You see problems as opportunities to prove yourself
You're someone who will work their face off to build the best product ever

Your Day-to-Day Will Look Like:
Building new features that will 10X a customer's workflow in Poppy AI
Building new features that will save users hundreds of hours of time
Optimizing existing code to make Poppy AI faster and more reliable
Fixing bugs before users even notice them
Jumping on calls with users to understand their pain points
Testing new ideas quickly to see what works
Refactoring code to make it more maintainable as we scale
Coming up with better solutions that will help creators, founders, or marketers
Teaching the rest of our team about new technologies you discover

What Success Looks Like:
Shipping features that users love and actually use 
Reducing Poppy AI's load times and improving performance
Contributing to our codebase in a way that makes it better, not just bigger (I hate reading shitty code)
Helping us hit $1M/month within six months

Who You Are (Specifically):
You've built and shipped real products that people use
You can look at a feature request and accurately estimate how long it will take to build
You have a system for writing clean, maintainable code that others can understand
You've turned a ""that's impossible"" into ""I figured it out"" by thinking of an angle nobody else tried
You're the person who gets excited to share new technologies with the team
You don't just code – you improve processes and teach others what you learn
You're comfortable working 12-15 hour days when needed because you're obsessed with results
You believe in both mental and physical strength – weak body, weak mind isn't your style

Requirements:
Strong experience with React.js and Next.js
Experience with AI SDKs and integrating with models like GPT-4, Claude, etc.
Familiarity with Supabase, Firebase, or similar database technologies
Experience with real-time collaboration tools like Live Blocks/PartyKit
Understanding of video/audio processing in web applications
Track record of building and scaling web applications
Ability to work in a fast-paced startup environment
Experience with TypeScript is a plus

Compensation & Benefits:
$70-140K base salary depending on your experience
Bonus checks based on product milestones and company growth
Equity in Poppy AI (0.1-0.5% depending on your experience)
Work from anywhere – we don't care when you work, we care what you achieve
Direct access to me and my co-founder (we answer Slack messages fast)
$20,000 worth of training and courses to level up your skills
1-on-1 personal development coaching from our C-suite to improve your non-coding skills)

The Poppy Team Culture (This Isn't Your Average Startup):
We just flew the entire team to Thailand where we rented a massive 5-bedroom villa with a huge pool. We worked our asses off during the day and played volleyball in the pool during breaks.
We're a team of savages who work 12-15 hours a day because we're obsessed with building something huge. We don't do the 4-hour workweek bullshit – we're building an empire.
We travel together to epic locations. Next up: Italy, Mexico, and Colombia. You'll have the opportunity to join us in these locations to work and bond with the team.
Physical training is a core part of our culture. We train Muay Thai and lift weights together. We believe in getting strong in your bank account, your muscles, and your mind.
When we hit big milestones, we celebrate big. But most days, we're heads down working harder than any team you've ever seen.
We're not just colleagues – we're a tribe of killers who push each other to be better every single day. The energy is contagious.

How to Apply:
Shoot us a Loom video (2-5 minutes, whatever you need) at jobs@getpoppy.ai

But listen – I don't just want to see your face talking about how great you are. SHOW ME YOUR WORK.
Screen share your GitHub or projects you've built
Demo EPIC projects you've built recently
Share examples of how you've solved difficult technical challenges
And tell us why should we hire you!

You’ll collaborate directly with customers, quickly iterate on features, and help close product gaps. The team moves fast and values rapid prototyping and customer feedback.

What You’ll Do
Build new features across the stack—from backend systems to frontend interfaces
Own key parts of the codebase and take projects from concept to production
Work on large-scale data pipelines that power customer workflows
Collaborate directly with customers to understand their needs and improve the product
Move quickly to ship updates and improve user experience

What You Bring
2+ years of experience as a full stack or generalist software engineer
Comfortable working across backend and frontend systems
Degree in computer science, computer engineering, or equivalent experience
Excited to work onsite in a fast-paced, early-stage startup
Comfortable taking ownership and working independently on complex projects

Founding Engineer/Tech Lead
Location: United States (Remote)
Compensation: $140,000-170,000 base salary (negotiable) + Significant equity (Pre-Seed)

A fast-evolving startup at the intersection of advertising, data, and hardware is looking for a Founding Software Engineer to take ownership of its core technology stack. The company operates a nationwide network of portable charging stations placed in high-traffic venues—from major sports stadiums to retail landmarks. These units serve as both utility and advertising platforms, delivering dynamic, targeted ad content and capturing rich user data in the process.

With national activations already live (NFL, MLB, Mall of America), this is a business with real traction and significant potential to scale. Backed by experienced advisors in AdTech and sports media, the company is currently bootstrapped and raising capital to accelerate product development and commercial growth.

The Role
This is a hands-on, high-impact engineering role reporting directly to the CEO and working closely with the CFO. You’ll lead the design and development of proprietary software, including a self-serve dashboard for advertisers and a data platform that surfaces insights from user behavior.

You won’t just be writing code—you’ll be shaping the entire product and engineering culture from the ground up. You’ll take the lead on building tools for advertisers, connecting data pipelines, and integrating hardware with software to create a seamless, scalable product experience.

This role is ideal for someone who thrives in early-stage environments, enjoys technical ownership, and wants to shape a product from the ground up.

What You’ll Work On
Build From Scratch: Design and develop a self-serve advertiser dashboard that allows clients to manage campaigns, view insights, and track performance.
Data: Create infrastructure to capture and surface behavioral data from thousands of devices, helping sponsors make smarter decisions.
Hardware + Software Integration: Work with QR-code-based flows and embedded systems that power real-time user interactions through charging hardware.
Full-Stack Execution: You’ll own both frontend and backend development—from database design to interface design—while setting engineering standards along the way.
Strategic Product Input: Work closely with leadership to shape the roadmap and bring ideas to life quickly, iterating based on user and client feedback.

What We’re Looking For
Strong Full-Stack Experience: You’ve built and launched full-stack applications end-to-end. Whether you're stronger on frontend or backend, you can comfortably handle both.
AdTech or CMS Knowledge: You’ve worked on advertising platforms, CMS systems, or similar tools where content, data, and user interaction come together.
Data Engineering Mindset: You understand the value of data pipelines, user attribution, and surfacing actionable insights for clients.
Startup Mentality: You’re resourceful, proactive, and love getting things done. You’re comfortable in unstructured environments and can work independently.
Hardware or IoT Exposure (Bonus): Experience with embedded systems, QR code integrations, or working on software that interacts with physical devices is a huge plus.

Our customers include national primary care practices operating in all 50 states as well as regional multi-specialty and urgent care health systems which care for 100,000+ underserved lives.

Healthcare is very hard. With decades of experience in healthcare operations and AI, we deeply understand healthcare workflows and have a deep network in this space, which has accelerated customer acquisition and product development.

The Role
We're seeking a driven Senior Full Stack Software Engineer with a passion for AI, healthcare, and building 0 to 1 products. We have a robust pipeline of clients and an ambitious, customer-validated roadmap that we want to build out quickly. As the third engineer, you'll be instrumental in shaping the product and developing our AI agent and patient communication platform. Tasks you might work on include:
Build and expand our voice and LLM stack to enable fast and natural conversations
Develop new communication modalities to allow customers to engage with their provider whichever way they prefer — phone, text, carrier pigeon (maybe)
Build a reusable yet customizable agent platform to enable fast customer onboarding
Build integrations with new electronic medical records (EMR) systems
Participate in customer calls to understand challenges of healthcare practices deeply and make decisions on how best to solve them
Work in an ambiguous environment and set your own tasks based on larger goals and understanding of customer needs

Who Should and Shouldn’t Apply
Being the third engineer at an early stage startup isn’t for everyone. It’s a different type of role with big risks, lots of work, but outsized, fulfilling rewards.

You should apply if…
You want to be shipping and solving customer problems instead of sitting in meetings.
You’re scrappy and get stuff done. If you’re testing noise reduction, you might test it at the cafe downstairs. You get out of the lab and into the real world.
You care deeply about the quality of the product you build. You get annoyed when a button is slightly off-centered or a system is slow.
You’ve tackled projects with a lot of technical and product ambiguity and owned it. You thrive in this environment and get excited that you can define what the solution looks like.
You like to join customer calls and hear what customers are saying about their problems and what you’ve built.
You are ambitious and don’t shy away from big challenges like fixing healthcare. You say “Challenge accepted” when faced with hard problems.

You shouldn’t apply if…
You have never taken ownership of a project before. You’re used to working with an engineering manager or Product Manager that gives very detailed instructions or Jira tickets on what to build.
You need a very detailed roadmap 3 years out and get annoyed if it’s not stuck to. We shoot for a north star but are constantly adapting and validating with customers and data. Agility is our advantage.
You have a big ego. You’ve never said “You might have a point here, I may be wrong”. We’re humble and we speak to people with respect even when we debate and disagree. Disagreement is good. We challenge each other to think differently and steel man the argument.
You want to manage people. We’re all do-ers and we hire senior people who are self-starters and mostly autonomous.
You want to work on exciting work all the time. There’s going to be mundane tasks that still need to get done. No matter your seniority, everyone will rotate through those.

Company Values
High Agency 🏋️‍♂️: Take ownership and get stuff done. See something wrong, fix it. Builders don’t wait or expect someone else will fix it.
Craftsmanship ✨: Sweat the details, delight users, and be proud of everything you ship. Leave things better than you found it. You don’t push the world forward doing an “okay” job. You need to do phenomenal work. Quality is not a plus; it's a must-have.
No ego 🤝: It's okay to admit you don't know something and ask for help — it's a sign of strength, not weakness. Always assume positive intent. We communicate in a kind, direct, and transparent way.
Curious 🔍: Always ask why and question how things can be better. Seek to understand the problem and the user needs.

Engineering Culture
We believe that engineers who deeply understand the customer and the business often come up with the best product ideas because they have a strong understanding of the technologies underlying a product and what’s possible. This allows them to identify opportunities for innovation that may not be apparent to others at the company or by the customer.

Interview Process
We move quickly and will get back to you with a decision on next steps within 48 hours after each round. This process can be as fast as 2 weeks.
30 minute intro call: understanding your background and what drives you
1 hour technical phone screen: problem solve through an evolving technical problem
On-Site interview
Reference Checks
Offer

Requirements
4+ years relevant work experience
Proven experience in designing and implementing scalable, robust backend systems.
Expertise in Python, Django, React, and/or Javascript is preferred but not required
Previous experience at a Series A or B startup is a plus.

Benefits and Perks
Excellent health, dental, and vision insurance
Free illy espresso, coffee, and beer
Curated snacks (ask about our snack cabinet)
Fitness stipend
Commuter benefits
Unlimited PTO
401(k)

This role is in-person at our office in San Francisco, CA by Montgomery BART. We enjoy the company of each other and being in the same space helps us move quicker, exchange ideas easily, and have fun while doing it. After 4 years, we’re quite tired of Zoom meetings all day.

Email, task management, and personal productivity software are a never ending stream of exciting, customer-life-changing challenges. Boomerang recently acquired GQueues, and we’re looking for veteran engineers who are excited about that intersection and want to use knowledge gleaned from years of working in software development teams to help us make both products better.

We have apps that millions of customers use every day (and pay for), and the infrastructure to support them efficiently and reliably at a reasonable cost. Our technology choices prioritize solving real user problems - when possible, we try to minimize complicated architecture and dependencies, but when it was necessary, we built a proprietary hybrid machine learning architecture. 

We need your judgment and experience to help us shave months of development time off critical projects, help us keep the servers alive a few extra nights a year, and share that judgment and experience across our engineering team.

The right candidate is already able to work at an expert level in one of the languages or frameworks we use at Boomerang/GQueues. You'll be able to share stories of mistakes you've made and learned from in past work, and you'll be able to identify the same mistakes as they are being made here. You already know how to interface with a product team, support team, marketing team, and leadership team to make everything run more smoothly. You’ve spent time over the past couple years exploring how AI can make you more productive, and it has. 

You can differentiate between when new platforms, frameworks, and design patterns solve real problems and when they're just shiny objects, and even more importantly, know how to communicate that knowledge to everyone who needs to know it. You're comfortable expressing your thoughts clearly in writing. You're collaborative and enjoy teaching people what you know, but also are receptive and open when someone else is in a position to teach you.

In return, you'll work in an environment that welcomes responsibility, where your work will help millions of people focus on the most rewarding parts of their jobs, and as part of a friendly, fun, elite team.

Requirements 
BA/BS Degree in Computer Science or related major, 5+ years of industry experience in a software development environment
Deep knowledge of at least one of the following technologies (the more the better!): 
HTML/CSS/JS, with jQuery
Solving CSS/JS multi-browser compatibility problems
Front-end performance optimization; Python + Django
Deep understanding of back-end technologies and databases (NoSQL is a plus)
Experience with Google Cloud a plus 
An interest in productivity software
An appreciation for boring technology

This firm operates at the critical intersection of finance and cutting-edge technology, specializing in quantitative trading and market making where processing information rapidly is essential. Their operations are fundamentally data-centric, revolving around the ingestion and analysis of immense volumes of high-resolution, time-series market data, measured in petabytes. Consequently, the ability to handle this data with extreme speed, efficiency, and down-to-the-nanosecond precision is not just a technical requirement but a core competitive necessity. Reflecting this, the company invests significantly in developing bespoke, highly optimized technological solutions, including custom data formats and performance tuning down to the hardware level, rather than relying on standard tools. This technological focus supports a collaborative environment where engineers build the sophisticated infrastructure required by researchers to develop and test data-driven strategies.

The requirement for this Senior Software Engineer stems directly from the extreme technical challenges posed by the firm's operating model. Standard data processing methods are insufficient for the petabyte-scale, high-velocity, high-resolution time-series data the company handles. Therefore, specialized engineering expertise is needed to design, build, and maintain systems capable of efficiently ingesting, parsing complex raw streams, cleaning, storing, and retrieving this information. Performance is absolutely critical in their field, demanding deep skills in high-performance C++/Python coding, low-level optimization techniques targeting memory layout and CPU cache efficiency, meticulous performance analysis through profiling and microbenchmarking, and the creation of custom binary formats to minimize latency and storage overhead.

Furthermore, the role is vital for ensuring the absolute integrity and accuracy of the data, particularly concerning nanosecond-level timestamp precision, handling out-of-order events, and programmatically resolving errors – inaccuracies can significantly impact trading outcomes. This senior engineer will be responsible for building the robust validation systems and data quality assurance processes required. They will also create the essential programmatic tools, libraries, and optimized data access layers (leveraging technologies like Kafka, PostgreSQL, Delta Lake, and AWS) that enable researchers to effectively query, join, and analyze these massive datasets for strategy development.

Essentially, this position is crucial for developing and maintaining the core, foundational data infrastructure and high-performance processing capabilities that underpin the firm's research and trading activities, including contributing to relevant precision-timing projects like White Rabbit.

Expertise:
Experience developing performance software for petabyte-scale data.
Strong C++/Python skills: low-level, memory, performance optimization.
Hands-on experience with nanosecond data programming challenges (time sync, temporal accuracy).
Experience with Pandas, Polars, PyArrow for large data.
Experience with Kafka, PostgreSQL, Delta Lake, AWS (programming perspective).
Proven low-level data parsing/manipulation experience (formats, streams, edge cases).
Familiarity with efficient data structures/algorithms for time series/large data.
Good collaboration/communication with researchers.

About the role
Glass Imaging is looking for a Machine Learning (ML) Infrastructure Engineer to re-design and develop the backbone of our ML training and evaluation ecosystem. As an experienced professional with a track record of success architecting solutions in this area, you will have the freedom to reshape our platform from the ground up—crafting everything from GPU allocation and data management to experiment tracking and evaluation pipelines.

You’ll be working closely with our ML researchers and engineers to understand their needs, streamline their workflows, and ensure that our platform can scale with the team. You will help create automated repeatable solutions, reducing manual overheads. While we prioritize clean, maintainable code, we operate in a fast-moving research environment where adaptability is key—this role offers plenty of opportunity to explore new ideas, refine solutions, and continuously improve our infrastructure. If you’re excited by the prospect of taking ownership of a system that will serve as the core of our ML efforts, we’d love to talk.

Right now, we’re looking for someone eager to tackle these challenges hands-on, but as our team grows, this role will have the opportunity to take on more leadership responsibility, guiding the continued development of our ML platform and helping shape the team around it.

Responsibilities
Design & build a scalable, efficient Python infrastructure for training and evaluating ML models.
Improve automation of ML train/test infrastructure. E.g. Inference tools that log, cache, and visually compare model outputs, provide code-free methods to run models on new datasets.
Develop and manage systems for GPU resource allocation, dataset management, experiment tracking, and evaluation pipelines. Integrate job scheduling (e.g. SLURM).
Implement automated dataset versioning and validation.
Build tools for reporting and visualizing model metrics and performance.
Improve developer efficiency by creating tools and workflows that streamline ML model iteration and testing. Add and improve performance profiling.
Ensure scalability and reliability of the ML platform as the company grows.
Collaborate closely with ML researchers and engineers to understand their workflows and translate their needs into robust infrastructure.
Introduce best practices for code organization, version control, and reproducibility in ML experiments. Encourage modularity, reusability and portability.

Required Skills
Strong software engineering / software architect level skills
Experience designing and building infrastructure for ML training workflows
Familiarity with performance profiling and optimization for ML training
Excellence in Python, Linux scripting, and typical ML frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
Experience with GPU management, distributed computing, and optimizing training pipelines
Passion for turning messy, unstructured codebases into clean, scalable platforms
Seeing the big picture in terms of code repo structure, job orchestration, task pipelining, and on-prem ML Ops for efficient resource usage

Preferred Skills
Proficiency in C++
Experience with customization/design of ML experiment tracking tools (e.g., Weights & Biases, ClearML, etc.); creation / customization of web GUIs and dashboards or Mac OS apps
Knowledge of database and storage solutions for ML datasets
Experience managing on site linux servers, NAS arrays, with large scale datasets
Knowledge of cloud computing (e.g. AWS, GCP, etc.) and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
Knowledge in image restoration and image quality assessment

Location & Travel
We are primarily hiring for positions in our SF Bay Area, CA (primarily in-person) office but may consider other arrangements for outstanding circumstances.

Who Are We?

Postman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 40 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500. Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.

The company is headquartered in San Francisco and has an office in Bangalore, where it was founded. Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on X via @getpostman.

P.S: We highly recommend reading The ""API-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.

The Opportunity

We Are Investing In a Growth Engineering Team At Postman To Help Developers And Teams Onboard To a Powerful Product Experience That Starts With Single-player Developers, And Grows Into Teams That Collaborate On The Artifact Of The APIs Like How Teams Collaborate With The Artifact Of a Design File Using Figma. We Are Building This Team For a Number Of Reasons, Notably

Optimize sign-up and onboarding experience for both individuals and teams
Help users uncover the power of Postman (it’s so much more than “just” an API client), gradually and at the right moment
Guide users to key activation moments (like creating their first collection, or inviting a member to their team) that lead to expansion and a stickier product experience

In effect: we know we have a product experience and funnel that works quite well. Now we want to optimize, tune, and make it even more amazing (and measure even more). We’re looking for an experienced engineer who has worked on projects that generated measurable business impact. You’ll work closely with Postman’s engineering leadership and our product and design teams to achieve our mission of connecting 100M developers in the world. We specifically hope this person is you, because while the team is small right now, we want an eager, curious engineer who cares about building experiences that delight, convert, and measurably impact the business and work with a team of like-minded individuals who care deeply, too.

We have built a ubiquitous, loved developer product and you’d be joining the solid and growing team in the United States. If you’re curious, see why I joined and hear about my experience in joining the rocket ship of an opportunity that is Postman.

What You’ll Do

About

To achieve our goals, we’ll need a talented, experienced, and thoughtful engineer with a special interest and aptitude for growth. We are looking for someone who cares deeply about the details and spends time building user interfaces that delight users. We need an engineer who can be somewhat self-directed and who has great taste, judgment, and can iterate (and ship!) quickly to achieve the iterative improvements to our first-time user experience. To quote Frank Slootman (former Snowflake CEO):

“Strategy is overrated and execution is severely underrated. Mostly all companies plan well and mostly all companies fail at execution. Make execution the king in your company.” – Frank Slootman, Amp it Up

Execution Is Key On The Growth Engineering Team. We’ll Need Someone Who Relentlessly Leads By Example On Execution And Ships Measurably Impactful Changes Regularly To The User Experience Of Postman. We’ll Progress And Continuously Improve Towards Achieving Our Goals And Metrics And Most Importantly We’ll Deliver An Increasingly Delightful Product Experience That Developers Love To Use. You Should Expect To

Own and deliver. Deliver improvements to the core product experience that help us achieve our goals around onboarding and activation
Deliver little big changes. Deliver small, measured changes that meaningfully impact end users and successful activation of these users

Experiment and identify winners. We have a great foundation of experimentation on the team and you will need to leverage and improve this foundation to ship A/B tested changes that we know have an impact on our goals. 

Own end-to-end workflows. Own end-to-end and understand core workflows, driving measurable improvements to user experience particularly focused on first-time user experience (sign-up, onboarding, and beyond)
Deeply understand the user. Collaborate and work with end users (developers!) using Postman to understand their core workflows and then use that knowledge to improve our product
Learn and grow. Broaden your knowledge of the core product and the domain over time, starting with first-time UX but eventually branching out into driving improvement to deeper experiences on the Postman user’s journey, and 
Collaborate across boundaries and geographies. Collaborate on team processes to streamline collaboration across US and India team members

About You

Must have:

At least 7+ years of experience building frontend or full-stack projects and user experiences. 
Track record of delivering impactful and engaging user experiences that delight users
Deep expertise in building the modern web with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You likely have used libraries or frameworks like React or Next.js, but we care much more about the fundamentals than the tech stack.
Excellent communication skills. We’re a hybrid team and we’re going to be moving fast together. Good communication is key.
Detail oriented. We have to care about the details, and while we don’t expect you to be a designer, you need to care about the product experience that our teams are shipping.
Measure twice, cut once. We expect that you are analytical by nature and have experience in delivering features, improvements, and changes that leverage analytics tools (like LaunchDarkly) and experimentation techniques. 
Customer obsession. As we are a core product with years of muscle memory, we need an engineer who is able and willing to leverage the voice of the customer to expedite decision making, develop conviction, and most importantly delight our user.
Based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Nice-to-have

Experience working with or using full-stack JavaScript / TypeScript
Experience working in a React application with state management tools like MobX
Experience working on B2B product and/or developer tools

Our frequent and fascinating team-building events will keep you connected, while our donation-matching program can support the causes you care about. We’re building a long-term company with an inclusive culture where everyone can be the best version of themselves.

At Postman, we embrace a hybrid work model. For all roles based out of San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Bangalore, Noida, Hyderabad, and New York, employees are expected to come into the office 3-days a week. We were thoughtful in our approach which is based on balancing flexibility and collaboration and grounded in feedback from our workforce, leadership team, and peers. The benefits of our hybrid office model will be shared knowledge, brainstorming sessions, communication, and building trust in-person that cannot be replicated via zoom.

Our Values

At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency and honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product.

Homeward is rearchitecting the delivery of health and care in partnership with communities everywhere, starting in rural America. Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we’re creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward’s mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo’s products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding.

About Retell
Retell is building the new standard for automating call center communications, including sales, support, customer engagement, and retention calls.

Backed by Altman Capital, Y Combinator, and top investors, we've raised a $4.7M seed round and hit $10M ARR in 15 months.

Check us out on the Top Lean AI Native Companies Leaderboard at leanaileaderboard.com.

Why This Company
Twenty years ago, every business found itself needing a website, the new gateway to the world. Platforms like WordPress and Squarespace rose to become the standard for getting businesses online.

Today, we’re at the start of a new shift. Every business that relies on phone interactions can now have an AI voice agent of their dreams. A tireless and empathetic receptionist, salesperson, debt collector, or appointment reminder that works 24/7. Operational bottlenecks vanish overnight. Doubling your business no longer means doubling your team. Customer experience no longer suffers. (Ever tried calling an East Coast bank after 3 p.m. PT?) But companies aren't ready. Platforms don't exist.

At Retell, we're building the new standard for building AI voice agents. A seamless UI, a comprehensive toolkit, effortless integrations, and a thriving builder community, we're creating everything businesses need to deliver exceptional phone interactions on every single call.

This shift is happening, so why not be part of the team that defines it?

Quick, Curious, & Collaborative – You thrive in fast-moving environments, learn new tools and frameworks quickly, and enjoy working across teams to get things done.

Our Compensation Philosophy
Our Strongest Offer, Upfront
We give you our best offer from the start. No need to negotiate or match other companies offer — instead, we offer three clear compensation options, each with a different balance of cash and equity. You pick what fits you best.
Designed for Talent Density
We’re building with the top 1%, not the average. That’s why our compensation is set far above market — to attract people who raise the bar for everyone around them.
Scale Through Code, Not Headcount
We aim for >$1M in revenue per employee. That means smaller teams, fewer layers, and higher ownership per person — both in terms of scope and equity.
Performance > Background
We don’t anchor to other companies, past salaries, or industry ranges. Your offer is based entirely on your performance in our interview process. That’s it.
Experience Doesn’t Dictate Pay
Your offer is based solely on how well you perform in the interview process. We don’t factor in past salaries, titles, or number of years worked. You can earn our highest tier with zero years of experience — if you prove you’re ready for it.

Interview Process
Online Assessment – We’ll kick things off with a short HackerRank assessment—two coding questions, 25–30 minutes total. You’ll have 7 days to complete and submit it.
Phone Interview 1 – A 30-minute live coding session focused on data structures and algorithms. We'll share a CoderPad link, and you’re free to use your preferred language.
Phone Interview 2 – A 30–45 minute technical interview with a focus in full-stack development using javascript, typescript, react and node JS.
Onsite Interviews – These take 1–4 hours and are conducted in person in the San Francisco Bay Area. Please bring a computer for any hands-on portions. For remote candidates, we’re happy to arrange virtual sessions. There are up to four rounds:
Practical Coding Session – Tackle real-world coding tasks, referencing documentation and debugging along the way.
System Design Interview – Walk through the architecture of a production-ready system and share your high-level thinking.
Tools & Automation Session – Build automations or use common developer tools to improve workflows.
Behavioral Interview – A conversation about your past experience, decision-making, and work style.",1,Needs an AI,Unknown,Unknown,Previous resume,False,Unknown,2025-05-07 15:01:14.184990,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4216747894,Easy Applied,"{('Phone country code [ ""List of phone country codes"" ]', 'Yes', 'select', 'United States (+1)'), ('Email address [  ""Select an option"", ""deepakbasavaraju7@gmail.com"", ""danny.basavaraju@gmail.com"", ""deepakbasavaraju16@gmail.com"", ]', 'Yes', 'select', 'deepakbasavaraju7@gmail.com'), ('mobile phone number', '628-310-5660', 'text', '628-310-5660')}",In Development

🚀 About the Role
We’re looking for a passionate, hands-on Founding Full-Stack Engineer to join our small but ambitious team. This role is a unique opportunity to shape the trajectory of a fast-growing company at its earliest and most formative stage. You’ll be building and scaling real products from day one—writing production code, talking directly to users, collaborating with founders, and solving messy, high-impact problems across the stack.

👤 Who You Are
You bring 4–10+ years of experience as a software engineer, with a deep understanding of modern web and backend development.
You've spent time in high-growth startups or product-focused teams, shipping features quickly, iterating with customer feedback, and balancing velocity with code quality.
You’re comfortable with ambiguity and thrive in fast-paced environments where ownership, autonomy, and initiative are not just buzzwords but part of daily life.
You may have a degree in Computer Science from a top-tier university, or you’ve accumulated equivalent experience by building and scaling real-world systems.
You are product-oriented and care about the ""why"" as much as the ""how""—you want to build things that matter and solve problems for real people.
You prefer in-person collaboration, especially in the early stages where whiteboards, hallway conversations, and team chemistry are crucial to momentum.
You're eager to wear multiple hats: building APIs, fixing performance bottlenecks, polishing UI, joining customer calls, debugging in prod, and helping define team culture.

🛠️ What You’ll Be Doing
Partner directly with the founders to architect, build, and scale core platform capabilities.
Take full ownership of features from concept to deployment—and beyond. You’ll write specs, sketch ideas on a whiteboard, code it, test it, deploy it, and follow up with users.
Regularly interact with customers to understand pain points, gather feedback, and prioritize improvements.
Contribute to critical technical decisions, such as how we scale our system, ensure observability, improve latency, and handle architectural trade-offs.
Participate in on-call rotations, rapid response to issues, and be ready to jump in when things break.
Help build the team: participate in interviews, mentor junior engineers as we grow, and help create the kind of engineering culture you’d want to work in for the next 5+ years.

🧱 Tech Stack
Backend: Go, built as a collection of microservices running in a fully serverless architecture on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.)
Frontend: React + TypeScript, deployed across web, mobile, and desktop platforms.
Data & AI: We’re building our own Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to power intelligent automation across the product.
DevOps & Tooling: CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Observability tools, and anything else you need to move fast and safely.

🌎 A Typical Day Might Include
Jumping on a call with a customer who ran into an edge case that slipped through QA—and debugging it live while chatting with them.
Designing a new Slack integration feature, getting buy-in from the team, and deploying the first version by EOD.
Discussing tradeoffs around caching strategies to improve response times on a latency-sensitive endpoint.
Joining a founder on a sales or onboarding call to hear customer feedback directly.
Reviewing a teammate’s PR and pushing one of your own.
Hanging out with the team after hours to talk about product vision, new tech, or just enjoy a meal together.

💬 Why This Role Is Unique
High impact from day one: Every line of code you write will reach users within hours, not weeks.
Close to the customer: You’ll hear customer feedback firsthand and see your work make a real difference.
Shape the culture and tech: This isn’t just another engineering job. You’ll play a central role in shaping how we work, what we build, and who we hire next.
Rapid growth: If you’ve been waiting for the right early-stage opportunity to put your skills to use and grow alongside a rocketship—this is it.",10,Needs an AI,Alb Berisha,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alb-berisha-844763272,Previous resume,False,Unknown,2025-05-07 15:57:18.611905,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4221377506,Easy Applied,"{('Phone country code [ ""List of phone country codes"" ]', 'Yes', 'select', 'United States (+1)'), ('mobile phone number', '628-310-5660', 'text', '628-310-5660'), ('Do you have good communication skills?

Job Title: Staff Engineer (or pick your own)
Job Type: Full-time
Company: Mentra
Location: San Francisco, in person
Pay: $80k - $150k
Equity: 0.2 - 2%

Mentra is building AugmentOS, the open source operating system for smart glasses. Smart glasses hardware has finally reached consumer-ready quality, but the software ecosystem is missing. AugmentOS fills this gap as the app store and SDK for smart glasses. We’re building the OS to power the next 8 billion personal computers and upgrade human intelligence.

We’ve raised from the founder of Android, founder of YouTube, Paul Graham, YC, and others. Our founding team brings deep expertise in smart glasses technology, with 6+ years of experience, 6 months in Shenzhen manufacturing, and roles at MIT Media Lab, Steve Mann's lab (the inventor of smart glasses + smart watch), Google, Salesforce, Adobe, Tsinghua University...

We’re building the world’s best smart glasses, and devs can build apps for them. That’s possible because of the iOS and Android client that connect the smart glasses to the apps in the cloud. You will be critical to helping us build out and harden the iOS and Android client apps that power AugmentOS.

Day-to-day you’ll be:

Mentra Live is our latest camera glasses. They have a full Android 11 SOC and we have a lot of things we're building: 

low latency, low power RTMP camera streaming for hours
cloud app control of the speakers, camera, microphones of the devices
low power optimization
BLE/Bluetooth Classic communication, HFP, SCO, etc.
implementation of AugmentOS core on Mentra Live and other camera glasses

We also have the concept of ""edge third party apps"" - these only work on Android (not on AugmentOS on iOS) but they allow developers to write third party apps that run as a native Android app on the edge, and communicate with AugmentOS via broadcast intents. We need help to re-enable this edge system, and deploy it.

And you'll be doing all this with a small, incredibly cracked, and growing team of people building the future of smart glasses.

What We’re Looking For

5+ years of Android experience
Strong with Java/Kotlin/C++
Solid experience with BLE on Android
BONUS: React Native, iOS native, Typescript backend
Loves smart glasses, building, and having fun

4221485090,Senior Android Engineer,Revi,vi,vi,"About the job
The Revi Mission 🚀
Brick and mortar is not dead but drastically changing, and Revi is leading that change into the future. 31 years ago, Web 1.0 started and it gave people the ability to click hyperlinks and read text. When Web 2.0 came about 10 years later, it revolutionized the world. It allowed people to do things like buy, ship, mail, shop, and more. 

In the past, doing these things was only reserved for an in-person physical experience, but they can now be done online. That one technological advancement, though simple, changed the world. Now, the internet is so robust that there are things you can do online that you can not do in a physical location. This is the next great shift in the market that Revi is calling Web 3.0. 

Companies are now trying to bring this digital experience into physical stores in their own siloed ecosystems. For example, Uber brings a simplified way to interact with cabs in the physical world, Bonobos brings a simplified way to interact with their physical retail stores, and the Amazon Go store simplifies purchasing in its physical stores. Revi is looking to bring this way of interacting with physical locations to all consumers, no matter what physical store you walk into. 

Revi offers businesses an in-store digital platform that allows businesses to build long-lasting relationships with their customers and allows consumers to interact with any business they walk into digitally. Our product is a beautifully designed in-store self-ordering system where consumers can buy, pay, get rewards, and much more. The data collected is leveraged to improve the ordering experience and attract new consumers. With a fresh round of Series A funding from top Silicon Valley seed investors, we are ready to pursue a multi-billion dollar opportunity.
